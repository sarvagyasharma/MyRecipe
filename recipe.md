Boil the rice and milk in a deep pan.
Simmer over low flame, stirring occasionally till the rice is cooked and the milk becomes thick.
When done add sugar, raisins and cardamoms.
Stir till sugar gets dissolved properly.
Transfer into a serving dish and garnish with almonds.

Serve hot or chilled. (i prefer chill in summer and hot in winter)
